# LyutMC

A voxel-based sandbox exploration game I'm making for fun and to learn Rust.

## Dependencies
- Rust Stable (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Running
`$ git clone https://github.com/moccy/lyutmc.git`
`$ cd lyutmc`
`$ cargo run`

## Notes
I've tested this using Vulkan and X for windowing. It might not work if you're using other APIs or windowing systems.
